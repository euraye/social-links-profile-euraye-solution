## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox for layout and how to implement responsive design using a mobile-first approach. I also gained experience working with CSS custom properties to maintain consistent styling throughout the project. Additionally, I improved my understanding of accessibility by ensuring all interactive elements have visible focus states.

### Continued development
In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills in responsive design and accessibility. I plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques and start applying JavaScript to enhance interactivity. Additionally, I aim to learn modern frameworks and experiment with component-based design approaches.
